# EstEID compatible JavaCard applets
Various JavaCard applets compatible<sup>*</sup> to EstEID chip protocol:

* [FakeEstEID](./docs/FakeEstEID.md)
* [MyEstEID](./docs/MyEstEID.md)
 
\* compatibility here only means that existing host-side software (Baastarkvara, OpenSC etc) can use the important parts of the card: keys and certificates with PIN verification. No "formal (full) compatibility" is implied.
